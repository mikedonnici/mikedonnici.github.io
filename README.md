# Mike Donnici

I am a highly motivated all-rounder with a strong foundation in full-stack development. Currently, my primary focus is
on backend services using Go and Python. I approach my work with enthusiasm and a constant drive for self-improvement,
always seeking to enhance my skills and to deliver efficient, scalable and understandable solutions.

In terms of the software developer [tribes](https://josephg.com/blog/3-tribes/), I'd place myself midway
between the _builder_ and _engineer_. My approach to software development strikes a balance between practical
problem-solving and performance optimisation. I value clarity over cleverness, aiming to create solutions that are both
functional and maintainable.
