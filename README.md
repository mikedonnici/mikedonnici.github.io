### Overview

An experienced software engineer specializing in backend services with Go and Python, driven by a passion for continuous
learning and improvement. Enthusiastic about breaking down complex domain problems, I actively contribute across all
phases, from concept to development and deployment, prioritizing clarity over cleverness and focusing on functional,
maintainable solutions.
